    "# File Drawer Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the \"File Drawer\" problem, a classic form of selection bias where a test statistic $Z$ is only observed or reported if it exceeds a certain threshold—often representing \"statistical significance.\" In this scenario, results that fail to meet the threshold are effectively left in the \"file drawer,\" leading to overestimates of effect sizes and inflated type I errors if standard inference is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We model a simple version of this phenomenon:\n",
    "- **Full Data**: $Z \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu, 1)$, where $\\mu$ is the true effect size we wish to estimate.\n",
    "- **Reporting Noise**: $\\omega \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\gamma^2)$, representing additional variability in the selection process (e.g., small variations in experimental conditions or data cleaning). We set $\\gamma = 0.5$.\n",
    "- **Selection Event**: The result is only \"published\" if the noisy version of the statistic, $Z + \\omega$, exceeds a threshold of 2.0.\n",
    "- **Observation**: We observe $Z = 1.73$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $Z=1.73$ is actually below the threshold of 2.0, but it was \"selected\" because the unobserved noise $\\omega$ was large enough to push $Z + \\omega$ over 2.0. If we ignore this selection process, we may produce confidence intervals\n",
    "with poor coverage and $p$-values with poor Type I error. Selective inference allows us to adjust for the fact that we are only looking at this data point because it passed the filter."

    "\n",
    "### The Weight Function\n",
    "The weight function $W(t) = P(Z + \\omega > 2 \\mid Z = t)$ is critical. It calculates the probability that the selection criterion is met for any possible realization $t$ of $Z$. \n",
    "- When $t$ is very large, the probability of selection is near 1.\n",
    "- When $t$ is very small, selection is unlikely but still possible if $\\omega$ is large.\n",
    "The plot generated above shows how this probability \"filters\" our view of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusting the Distribution\n",
    "In standard inference, we would use $Z \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu, 1)$. However, given selection, the conditional distribution of $Z$ is:\n",
    "$$f_{\\mu}(z \\mid \\text{selected}) \\propto \\phi(z-\\mu) \\cdot W(z)$$\n",
    "The `discrete_family` class takes a grid of values and their corresponding weights (the product of the base density and the selection weight) to represent this adjusted exponential family.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valid Post-Selection Inference\n",
    "By inverting the tests in this adjusted family, we obtain confidence intervals and p-values that are valid even though the data point was chosen specifically because it was \"large.\" This approach directly mitigates the bias inherent in the file-drawer effect, providing a more honest assessment of the evidence."
